A system and eventually some software used to Get S@#$% Done


## Warning

This documentation is pre-release and is probably not suitable for use.  Users beware! (better yet, check back later)

There is no source initially, but when it appears you're probably better off glancing at it and re-writing from scratch...

## Note

This documentation is in the process of being implemented, in Sphinx.  As a result, there's not much to be seen.  When something is ready, I'll set it up either with readthedocs, with github's infrastructure, or with the equivalent (should be easy for Jenkins to pull every commit and build on my server, right?).
